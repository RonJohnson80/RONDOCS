The Jump Box I created with a Ansible container reqires a SSH public key which will be use to configure all other VMs within the network I will be remotely (SSH) connecting to.
 
'ssh-keygen' : command to create ssh key 


To start the process of creating my public key I SSH into the Jump Box with the following command:

'ssh sysadmin@<jump box VM IP>'

In order to locate and identify my container I ran the following command while in Jump Box (Gateway VM): 

'sudo docker container list -a'

After Identifying the name of my container I was able to start my container by running the following command:


sudo docker start [container-name]

Next I attached my container  as follows:


'sudo docker attach [container-name]'

Note: this step identify the host name in the command prompt as an indication you have attached to the container

Here I use the following command to create my ssh public key:

'ssh-keygen'

With no password I saved the key in > (/root/.ssh/id_rsa) file: .ssh/id_rsa.pub 

I then copied the public key and used it as the password as I created and configure each VM in my network.

I use command 'cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub' to reveal my ssh public key for me to copy
 

I can now use my Jump Box as a Gateway server; this is required to exicute Linux commands for each related components in my network.

I first created a host text file: nano /etc/ansible/hosts

In this file I created a inventory of servers groups [webservers] and [elk]
 - Identify them by their IP 
 - Specify each one with python3 by adding 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'

Example:

# /etc/ansible/hosts


[webservers]
 
10.0.0.4 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
 
10.0.0.5 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
 
10.0.0.6 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

 

[elk]
 
10.1.0.4 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
